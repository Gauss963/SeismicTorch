    abstract = "{Earthquake detection is the critical first step in earthquake early warning (EEW) systems. For robust EEW systems, detection accuracy, detection latency, and sensor density are critical to providing real‐time earthquake alerts. Traditional EEW systems use fixed sensor networks or, more recently, networks of mobile phones equipped with microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometers. Internet of things edge devices, with built‐in tiny machine learning (tinyML) capable microcontrollers, and always‐on, internet‐connected, stationary MEMS accelerometers provide the opportunity to deploy ML‐based earthquake detection and warning using a single‐station approach at a global scale. Here, I test and evaluate tinyML deep learning algorithms for earthquake detection on a microcontroller. I show that the tinyML earthquake detection models can generalize to earthquakes outside the training set.}",

ABSTRACT = {The detection of seismic signals is vital in seismic data processing and analysis. Many algorithms have been proposed to resolve this issue, such as the ratio of short-term and long-term power averages (STA/LTA), F detector, Generalize F, and etc. However, the detection performance will be affected by the noise signals severely. In this paper, we propose a novel seismic signal detection method based on the historical waveform features to improve the seismic signals detection performance and reduce the affection from the noise signals. We use the historical events location information in a specific area and waveform features information to build the joint probability model. For the new signal from this area, we can determine whether it is the seismic signal according to the value of the joint probability. The waveform features used to construct the model include the average spectral energy on a specific frequency band, the energy of the component obtained by decomposing the signal through empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and the peak and the ratio of STA/LTA trace. We use the Gaussian process (GP) to build each feature model and finally get a multi-features joint probability model. The historical events location information is used as the kernel of the GP, and the historical waveform features are used to train the hyperparameters of GP. The beamforming data of the seismic array KSRS of International Monitoring System are used to train and test the model. The testing results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

    abstract = "{To optimally monitor earthquake‐generating processes, seismologists have sought to lower detection sensitivities ever since instrumental seismic networks were started about a century ago. Recently, it has become possible to search continuous waveform archives for replicas of previously recorded events (i.e., template matching), which has led to at least an order of magnitude increase in the number of detected earthquakes and greatly sharpened our view of geological structures. Earthquake catalogs produced in this fashion, however, are heavily biased in that they are completely blind to events for which no templates are available, such as in previously quiet regions or for very large‐magnitude events. Here, we show that with deep learning, we can overcome such biases without sacrificing detection sensitivity. We trained a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) on the vast hand‐labeled data archives of the Southern California Seismic Network to detect seismic body‐wave phases. We show that the ConvNet is extremely sensitive and robust in detecting phases even when masked by high background noise and when the ConvNet is applied to new data that are not represented in the training set (in particular, very large‐magnitude events). This generalized phase detection framework will significantly improve earthquake monitoring and catalogs, which form the underlying basis for a wide range of basic and applied seismological research.}",
